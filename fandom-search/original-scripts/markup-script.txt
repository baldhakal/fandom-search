CHARACTER_NAME<<Intro Text>>

LINE<<A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<YOUNG JYN>>

LINE<<Mama.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<LYRA>>

LINE<<We know. Jyn, gather your things, it's time.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<SAW GERRERA>>

LINE<<Hello.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<LYRA>>

LINE<<Saw, it's Lyra. It's happened. He's come for us.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<SAW GERRERA>>

LINE<<You know what to do.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<GALEN>>

LINE<<Jyn, come here. Remember, whatever I do, I do it to protect>>
LINE<<you. Say you understand.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<YOUNG JYN>>

LINE<<I understand.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<GALEN ERSO>>

LINE<<I love you, Stardust.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<YOUNG JYN>>

LINE<<I love you too, Papa.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<LYRA>>

LINE<<Galen.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<GALEN>>

LINE<<Go.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<LYRA>>

LINE<<Jyn. You know where to go, don't you? Trust the Force.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<You're a hard man to find, Galen. But farming? Really, a man>>
LINE<<of your talents?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<GALEN ERSO>>

LINE<<It's a peaceful life.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<It's lonely, I imagine.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<GALEN ERSO>>

LINE<<Since Lyra died, yes.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<Oh. Oh. My condolences. Search the house!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<DEATHTROOPER>>

LINE<<Understood.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<GALEN ERSO>>

LINE<<What is it you want?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<The work has stalled, I need you to come back.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<GALEN ERSO>>

LINE<<I won't do it, Krennic.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<We're on the verge of greatness. We were this close to providing>>
LINE<<peace, security for the galaxy.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<GALEN ERSO>>

LINE<<You're confusing peace with terror.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<Do I, huh? You have to start somewhere.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<GALEN ERSO>>

LINE<<I'll be of no help, Krennic. My mind just isn't what it was.>>
LINE<<I have trouble remembering, even simple things.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<Galen, you're an inspired scientist but you're a terrible liar.>>
LINE<<Now I admire the effort, I really do.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<Oh look, here's Lyra back from the dead. It's a miracle.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<Stop!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<Oh, Lyra. Troublesome as ever.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<LYRA>>

LINE<<You're not taking him.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<No, of course I'm not. I'm taking you all. You'll all come.>>
LINE<<You, your child, You'll all live in comfort.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<LYRA>>

LINE<<As hostages.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<As 'heroes of the Empire.'>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<GALEN>>

LINE<<Lyra. Put it down. Think very carefully.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<LYRA>>

LINE<<You will never win.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<Do it.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<GALEN>>

LINE<<Lyra! No!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<They have a child. Find it!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<SAW GERRERA>>

LINE<<My child. Come. Come. We have a long ride ahead of us.>>

DIRECTION<<ROGUE ONE>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<STORMTROOPER>>

LINE<<Check in, security. Cell block 4227. 4227.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<TIVIK>>

LINE<<I was about to leave.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<I came as fast as I could.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<TIVIK>>

LINE<<I have to get back on board. Walk with me.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Back to Jedha?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<TIVIK>>

LINE<<They'll leave without me!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Easy. You have news from Jedha? Come on.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<TIVIK>>

LINE<<An Imperial pilot, one of the cargo drivers. He defected>>
LINE<<yesterday. He's telling people they're making a weapon. The>>
LINE<<kyber crystals, that's what they're for.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<What kind of weapon?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<TIVIK>>

LINE<<Look, I have to go.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<What kind of weapon?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<TIVIK>>

LINE<<A planet killer. That's what he called it.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<A planet killer?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<TIVIK>>

LINE<<Someone named Erso sent him. Some old friend of Saw's.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Galen Erso? Was it?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<TIVIK>>

LINE<<I don't know! They were looking for Saw when we left.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Who else knows this?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<TIVIK>>

LINE<<I have no idea!It's all falling apart. Saw's right, there're>>
LINE<<spies everywhere.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<STORMTROOPER>>

LINE<<What's all this?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<STORMTROOPER>>

LINE<<Come on, let's see some scandocs.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Yeah, of course. My gloves?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<TIVIK>>

LINE<<No, What've you done?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<STORMTROOPERS>>

LINE<<Troopers down, section 9.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<TIVIK>>

LINE<<Are you crazy? I'll never climb out of here. My arm...>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<STORMTROOPER>>

LINE<<Get out of the way. Move! Move!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Calm down. Calm down. We'll be all right.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<MILITIA>>

LINE<<Sir.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<Is that him? He looks kind of different than I imagined.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<MILITIA>>

LINE<<On your feet! It's the pilot, the defector.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<Okay, so you're-you're Saw Gerrera? Saw Gerrera. No? Okay, we're>>
LINE<<just wasting time that we don't have. I need to speak to Saw>>
LINE<<Gerrera! I keep telling them before, before it's too late.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<MILITIA>>

LINE<<Keep your heads down! The Imperials will be searching for him...>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<We're out here in the middle of nowhere. We need to get to Jedha>>
LINE<<City. What part of urgent message do you guys not understand?>>
LINE<<Hey! we're all on the same side, if you just see past the uniform>>
LINE<<for a minute. I've got to speak to ah... I've got to speak to>>
LINE<<Saw Gerrera.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<STORMTROOPER>>

LINE<<What now?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<STORMTROOPER>>

LINE<<I don't know. Must be another pick up.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<STORMTROOPER>>

LINE<<I thought we had everybody.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<SOLDIER>>

LINE<<All clear, sir.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<MELSHI>>

LINE<<Hallik! Liana Hallik!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<SOLDIER>>

LINE<<Her.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<MELSHI>>

LINE<<You want to get out of here?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<PRISONER>>

LINE<<Hey! What about me?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

DIRECTION<<Chokeslamming Jyn for trying to escape>>

LINE<<Congratulations. You are being rescued. Please do not resist.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<PA>>

LINE<<LU-28, report to maintenance level 4.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<GENERAL DRAVEN>>

LINE<<You're currently calling yourself Liana Hallik. Is>>
LINE<<that correct? Possession of unsanctioned weapons, forgery of>>
LINE<<Imperial documents, aggravated assault, escape from custody,>>
LINE<<resisting arrest Imagine if the Imperial authorities had found>>
LINE<<out who you really were. Jyn Erso? That's your given name, is>>
LINE<<it not? Jyn Erso? Daughter of Galen Erso. A known Imperial>>
LINE<<collaborator in weapons development.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<What is this?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<MON MOTHMA>>

LINE<<It's a chance for you to make a fresh start.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<We think you might be able to help us.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<MON MOTHMA>>

LINE<<This is Captain Cassian Andor, Rebel Intelligence.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<When was the last time you were in contact with your father?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<15 years ago.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Any idea where he's been all that time?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<I like to think he's dead, makes things easier.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Easier than what? That he's being a tool of the Imperial war>>
LINE<<machine?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<I've never had the luxury of political opinions.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Really? When was your last contact with Saw Gerrera?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<It's been a long time.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<He'd remember you, though, wouldn't he? He might agree to meet>>
LINE<<you, if you came as a friend.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<DRAVEN>>

LINE<<We're up against the clock here, girl, So if there's nothing>>
LINE<<to talk about, we'll just put you back where we found you.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<I was a child, Saw Gerrera saved my life. He raised me. But>>
LINE<<I've no idea where he is. I haven't seen him in years.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<We know how to find him, that's not our problem. What we need>>
LINE<<is someone who gets us through the door without being killed.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<You're all rebels, aren't you?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<MON MOTHMA>>

LINE<<Yes, but Saw Gerrera's an extremist. He's been fighting on his>>
LINE<<own since he broke with the Rebellion. His militancy has caused>>
LINE<<the Alliance a great many problems. We have no choice now but>>
LINE<<to try to mend that broken trust.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<What does this have to do with my father?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<There's an Imperial defector in Jedha. A pilot. He's being held>>
LINE<<by Saw Gerrera. He's claiming the Emperor is creating a weapon>>
LINE<<with the power to destroy entire planets. The pilot says he>>
LINE<<was sent by your father.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<MON MOTHMA>>

LINE<<We need to stop this weapon before it is finished.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<DRAVEN>>

LINE<<Captain Andor's mission is to authenticate the pilot's story>>
LINE<<and then, if possible, find your father.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<MON MOTHMA>>

LINE<<It appears he is critical to the development of this superweapon.>>
LINE<<Given the gravity of the situation and your history with Saw,>>
LINE<<we're hoping that he will help us locate your father and return>>
LINE<<him to the Senate for testimony.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<And if I do it?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<MON MOTHMA>>

LINE<<We'll make sure you go free.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<GENERAL DRAVEN>>

LINE<<Captain Andor!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<I'm K-2SO. I'm a reprogrammed Imperial droid.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<I remember you.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<I see the Council is sending you with us to Jedha.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<Apparently so.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<That is a bad idea. I think so, and so does Cassian. What do>>
LINE<<I know? My specialty is just strategic analysis.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<GENERAL DRAVEN>>

LINE<<Galen Erso is vital to the Empire's weapon program. Forget what>>
LINE<<you heard in there, there will be no extraction. You find him,>>
LINE<<you kill him. Then and there.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<You met Kay-Tu?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<Charming.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<He tends to say whatever comes into his circuits. It's a>>
LINE<<by-product of the reprogram.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>> 

LINE<<Why does she get a blaster, and I don't?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<What.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<I know how to use it.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<That's what I'm afraid of. Give it to me.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<We're going to Jedha. That's a war zone.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<That's not the point. Where did you get it?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<I found it.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<I find that answer vague and unconvincing.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<Trust goes both ways.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<You're letting her keep it? Would you like to know>>
LINE<<the probability of her using it against you? It's high.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Let's get going.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<It's very high.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<SAW GERRERA>>

LINE<<Lies!Deceptions!Let's see it. Bodhi Rook. Cargo pilot. Local>>
LINE<<boy, huh?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<Uh-huh.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<MILITIA>>

LINE<<This was found in his boot when he was captured.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<Okay, I can hear you. He didn't capture me, I came here myself. I>>
LINE<<defected, I defected.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<SAW GERRERA>>

LINE<<Every day, more lies.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<Lies? Would I risk everything for a lie? No, we don't have time>>
LINE<<for this! I have to speak to Saw Gerrera before it's too late.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<Okay... So, you... Um. Uh. That's-That's for you. And I gave>>
LINE<<it to them, they did not find it! I gave it to them. Galen Erso.>>
LINE<<He told me to find you.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<SAW GERRERA>>

LINE<<Bor Gullet.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<Bor Gullet? Galen Erso sent me! He told me to find you!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<TARKIN>>

LINE<<Most unfortunate about the security breach on Jedha, Director>>
LINE<<Krennic. After so many setbacks and delays, and now this. We've>>
LINE<<heard word of rumors circulating through the city. Apparently>>
LINE<<you've lost a rather talkative cargo pilot. If the Senate gets>>
LINE<<wind of our project, countless systems will flock to the Rebellion.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<When the battle station is finished, Governor Tarkin, the Senate>>
LINE<<will be of little concern.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<TARKIN>>

LINE<<When has become now, Director Krennic. The Emperor>>
LINE<<will tolerate no further delay, you have made time>>
LINE<<an ally of the Rebellion. I suggest, we solve both problems>>
LINE<<simultaneously with an immediate test of the weapon. Failure will>>
LINE<<find you explaining why to a far less patient audience.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<I will not fail.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<GALEN>>

LINE<<What's the matter, Jyn? You looked frightened. I'll always>>
LINE<<protect you. Stardust. Don't ever change.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<LYRA>>

LINE<<Trust...>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<LYRA>>

LINE<<Galen.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<We're coming into orbit. You have controls.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<That's Jedha. Or what's left of it. We find Saw, we find your>>
LINE<<father.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<What's with the Destroyer?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<It's because of your old friend, Saw Gerrera. He's>>
LINE<<been attacking the cargo shipments.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<What are they bringing in?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<It's 'what are they taking out?' Kyber crystal. All they can>>
LINE<<get. We wondered why they were stripping the temple, now we know.>>
LINE<<It's the fuel for the weapon.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<The weapon your father's building.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<Maybe we should leave target practice behind.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<Are you talking about me?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<She's right. We need to blend in. Stay with the ship.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<I can blend in. I'm an Imperial droid. This city is under>>
LINE<<Imperial occupation>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<Half the people here want to reprogram you. The other half want>>
LINE<<to put a hole in your head.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<I'm surprised you're so concerned with my safety.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<I'm not. I'm just worried they might miss you and hit me.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<Doesn't sound so bad to me.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<SAW GERRERA>>

LINE<<Bor Gullet can feel your thoughts, No lie is safe. What have>>
LINE<<you really brought me, cargo pilot? Bor Gullet will>>
LINE<<know the truth. The unfortunate side effect, is that one tends to>>
LINE<<lose one's mind.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<No.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<DR. EVAZAN>>

LINE<<Hey, you just watch yourself.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<No, no. Tourist, we don't want any trouble, sorry. Come on.>>
LINE<<Come on.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<STORMTROOPER>>

LINE<<Citizens of Jedha,you must come forward with information of the>>
LINE<<location of this missing cargo pilot. A reward of 600 credits for>>
LINE<<the information shall be awarded.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<I had a contact, one of Saw's rebels, but he's just gone missing.>>
LINE<<His sister will be looking for him. The temple's been destroyed>>
LINE<<but she'll be there waiting. We'll give her your name and hope>>
LINE<<that gets us a meeting with Saw.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<Hope?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Yeah. Rebellions are built on hope.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<STORMTROOPER>>

LINE<<Hands where I can see them. Get over there. Show me some>>
LINE<<identification. Check inside.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<Is this all because of your pilot?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<May the Force of others be with you. May the Force of others>>
LINE<<be with you.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Wait for me.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<May the Force of others be with you. May the Force of others>>
LINE<<be with you.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<Would you trade that necklace for a glimpse into your future?>>
LINE<<Yes, I'm speaking to you. I am Chirrut Îmwe.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<How did you know I was wearing a necklace?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<For that answer you must pay. What do you know of kyber crystals?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<My father, he said they powered the Jedi lightsabers.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Jyn. Come on, let's go.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<The strongest stars have hearts of kyber.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Let's go. We're not here to make friends.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<Who are they?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<The Guardians of the Whills. Protectors of the Kyber Temple.>>
LINE<<But there's nothing left to protect, so now they're just causing>>
LINE<<trouble for everybody.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<You seem awfully tense all of a sudden.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<We have to hurry. This town, it's ready to blow.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<STORMTROOPER>>

LINE<<Citizens of the Empire, Imperial forces...>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<Tell me you have a backup plan.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<STORMTROOPER>>

LINE<<Incoming.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<STORMTROOPER>>

LINE<<Put your guns down.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<STORMTROOPER>>

LINE<<Behind us.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<Looks like we found Saw's rebels.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Jyn, no!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<MOTHER>>

LINE<<Thank you.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<STORMTROOPER>>

LINE<<Hit the tower.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CITIZEN>>

LINE<<Get out of there!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CITIZEN>>

LINE<<Quickly, the kyber, get it. Here, take the kyber. Take the>>
LINE<<kyber. Come on!>> 

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<This way!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<Did you know that wasn't me?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<Of course!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<I thought I told you to stay on the ship.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<You did, but I thought it was boring, and you were>>
LINE<<in trouble. There are a lot of explosions for two people blending>>
LINE<<in.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<STORMTROOPER>>

LINE<<Freeze right there...>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<You're right, I should just wait on the ship.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<STORMTROOPER>>

LINE<<Halt! Stop right there!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<STORMTROOPER>>

LINE<<Where are you taking these prisoners?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<These are prisoners.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<STORMTROOPER>>

LINE<<Yes. Where are you taking them?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<I am taking them... to imprison them. In prison.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<He's taking us to...>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<Quiet! And there's a fresh one if you mouth off again!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<STORMTROOPER>>

LINE<<We'll take them from here.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<That's okay. If you could just point me in the right direction, I>>
LINE<<can take them, I'm sure. I've taken them this far...>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Hey, wait a second.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<STORMTROOPER>>

LINE<<Take them away.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<Wait!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<STORMTROOPER>>

LINE<<Hey, droid. You can't take them away! You stay here. We need>>
LINE<<to check your diagnostics.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<Diagnostics? I'm capable of running my own diagnostics, thank you>>
LINE<<very much.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<Let them pass in peace! Let them pass in peace. The Force is>>
LINE<<with me, and I am with the Force. And I fear nothing, for all is>>
LINE<<as the Force wills it.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<STORMTROOPER>>

LINE<<Hey! Stop right there!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<STORMTROOPER>>

LINE<<He's blind.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<STORMTROOPER>>

LINE<<Is he deaf?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<STORMTROOPER>>

LINE<<I said: Stop right there!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<Is your foot all right?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<You almost shot me.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BAZE>>

LINE<<You're welcome.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<Clear of hostiles!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<One hostile!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<He's with us!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<They're all right.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<Thanks.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<Cassian, I'm sorry about the slap.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Go back to the ship. Wait for my call.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Is he a Jedi?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BAZE>>

LINE<<There are no Jedi here anymore. Only dreamers like this fool.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<The Force did protect me.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BAZE>>

LINE<<I protected you.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<Can you get us to Saw Gerrera?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<Can't you see we are no friends of the Empire?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<MILITIA>>

LINE<<Tell that to the one who killed our men.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<Anyone who kills me or my friends will answer to Saw Gerrera.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<MILITIA>>

LINE<<And why Is that?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<Because I am the daughter of Galen Erso.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<MILITIA>>

LINE<<Take them!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<Are you kidding me? I'm blind!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me. I'm one with the>>
LINE<<Force and the Force is with me.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BAZE>>

LINE<<You pray?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BAZE>>

LINE<<Really?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BAZE>>

LINE<<He's praying for the door to open.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<It bothers him, because he knows it is possible. Baze Malbus>>
LINE<<was once the most devoted Guardian of us all.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<I'm beginning to think the Force and I have different priorities.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BAZE>>

LINE<<Relax, Captain. We've been in worse cages than this one.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<This is a first for me.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<There is more than one sort of prison, Captain, I sense that>>
LINE<<you carry yours wherever you go.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<SAW GERRERA>>

LINE<<Jyn. Is it really you? I can't believe it.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<Must be quite a surprise.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<SAW GERRERA>>

LINE<<Are we not still friends?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<The last time I saw you, you gave me a knife and loaded blaster>>
LINE<<and told me to wait in a bunker until daylight.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<SAW GERRERA>>

LINE<<I knew you were safe.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<You left me behind.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<SAW GERRERA>>

LINE<<You were already the best soldier in my cadre.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<I was sixteen.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<SAW GERRERA>>

LINE<<I was protecting you!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<You dumped me!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<SAW GERRERA>>

LINE<<You were the daughter of an Imperial science officer! People>>
LINE<<were starting to figure that out. People who wanted to- to use>>
LINE<<you as a hostage. Not a day goes by that I don't think of you.>>
LINE<<But today, of all days? It's a trap, isn't it?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<What?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<SAW GERRERA>>

LINE<<The pilot! The message. All of it. Did they... send you? Did>>
LINE<<you come here to kill me? There's not much of me left.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<The Alliance wants my father. They think he's sent>>
LINE<<you a message about a weapon. I guess they think by sending me>>
LINE<<you might actually help them out.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<SAW GERRERA>>

LINE<<So what is it that you want, Jyn?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<They wanted an introduction, they've got it. I'm out now. The>>
LINE<<rest of you can do what you want.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<SAW GERRERA>>

LINE<<You care not about the cause?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<The cause? Seriously? The Alliance? The...The rebels? Whatever it>>
LINE<<is you're calling yourself these days? All it's ever brought>>
LINE<<me is pain.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<SAW GERRERA>>

LINE<<You can stand to see the Imperial flag reign across the galaxy?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<It's not a problem if you don't look up.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<SAW GERRERA>>

LINE<<I have something to show you, come.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<TARKIN>>

LINE<<The Emperor is awaiting my report.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<One had hoped that he and Lord Vader might have been here for>>
LINE<<such an occasion.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<TARKIN>>

LINE<<And I thought it prudent to save you from any potential embarrassment.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<Your concern is hardly warranted.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<TARKIN>>

LINE<<If saying it would only make it so.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<All Imperial forces, have been evacuated, and I stand ready to>>
LINE<<destroy the entire moon.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<TARKIN>>

LINE<<That won't be necessary. We need a statement, not a manifesto.>>
LINE<<The Holy City will be enough for the day.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<Target Jedha City, prepare single reactor ignition.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<OFFICER>>

LINE<<Sir, we're in position, ready to...>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<Fire!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<OFFICER>>

LINE<<Commence primary ignition.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<Who's the one in the next cell?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<What? Where?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BAZE>>

LINE<<An Imperial pilot.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Pilot?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BAZE>>

LINE<<I'm going to kill him!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<No, no, No, wait!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BAZE>>

LINE<<Come here!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<NO!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BAZE>>

LINE<<Back off. Back off.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Okay.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Are you the pilot? Hey, heyare you the pilot? The shuttle pilot?>>
LINE<<Pilot?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<What's wrong with him?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Galen Erso. You know that name?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<I brought the message, I'm the pilot. I'm the pilot. I'm the>>
LINE<<pilot.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Okay, good. Now where is Galen Erso?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<OFFICER>>

LINE<<Standby.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<SAW GERRERA>>

LINE<<This is the message I was sent.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<GALEN ERSO>>

LINE<<Saw, if you're watching this, then perhaps there is a chance>>
LINE<<to save the Alliance. Perhaps there's a chance to explain myself>>
LINE<<and, though I don't dare hope for too much, a chance for Jyn, if>>
LINE<<she's alive, if you can possibly find her to let her know that my>>
LINE<<love for her has never faded and how desperately I've missed her.>>
LINE<<Jyn, my Stardust, I can't imagine what you think of me. When I>>
LINE<<was taken, I faced some bitter truths. I was told that, soon>>
LINE<<enough, Krennic would have you as well. As time went by, I knew>>
LINE<<that you were either dead or so well hidden that he would never>>
LINE<<find you. I knew if I refused to work, if I took my own life, it>>
LINE<<would only be a matter of time before Krennic realized he no>>
LINE<<longer needed me to complete the project. So I did the one thing>>
LINE<<that nobody expected: I lied. I learned to lie. I played the part>>
LINE<<of a beaten man resigned to the sanctuary of his work. I made>>
LINE<<myself indispensable, and all the while I laid the groundwork of>>
LINE<<my revenge. We call it the Death Star. There is no better name.>>
LINE<<And the day is coming soon when it will be unleashed. I've placed>>
LINE<<a weakness deep within the system. A flaw so small and powerful,>>
LINE<<they'll never find it. But, Jyn. Jyn, if you're listening My>>
LINE<<beloved, so much of my life has been wasted. I try to think of>>
LINE<<you only in the moments when I'm strong, because the pain of not>>
LINE<<having you with me. Your mother. Our family. The pain of that loss>>
LINE<<is so overwhelming I risk failing even now. It's just so hard not>>
LINE<<to think of you. Think of where you are. My Stardust. Saw, the>>
LINE<<reactor module, that's the key. That's the place I've laid my>>
LINE<<trap. It's well hidden and unstable, one blast to any part of it>>
LINE<<will destroy the entire station. You'll need the plans, the>>
LINE<<structural plans for the Death Star to find the reactor. I know>>
LINE<<there's a complete engineering archive in the data vault at the>>
LINE<<Citadel Tower on Scarif. Any pressurized explosion to the reactor>>
LINE<<module will set off a chain reaction that will destroy the>>
LINE<<entire station...>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Go. Go.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<K-2? K-2, where are you?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<There you are. I'm standing by as you requested. Although there's>>
LINE<<a problem on the horizon. There is no horizon.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Locate our position. Bring that ship in here now!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<Where are you going?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<I've got to find Jyn. Get the pilot. We need him.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BAZE>>

LINE<<All right. I'll get the pilot.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BAZE>>

LINE<<Pilot.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<No, no, no.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BAZE>>

LINE<<Let's go.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Jyn! We've got to go. I know where your father is.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<SAW GERRERA>>

LINE<<Go with him, Jyn. You must go.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<Come with us.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<SAW GERRERA>>

LINE<<I will run no longer.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Come on.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN ERSO>>

LINE<<But you must save yourself.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Come on.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<SAW GERRERA>>

LINE<<Go! There's no time! Save the Rebellion! Save the dream!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<Oh. It's beautiful.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BAZE>>

LINE<<Chirrut, let's go!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

DIRECTION<<to Bodhi>>

LINE<<Come on! Let's get out of here!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Get us out of here! Punch it!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<I'm not very optimistic about our odds.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Let's not, K. Come on! Punch it.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<I haven't completed my calculation.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<I'll make them for you.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<TARKIN>>

LINE<<I believe I owe you an apology, Director Krennic. Your work>>
LINE<<exceeds all expectations.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<And you'll tell the Emperor as much?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<TARKIN>>

LINE<<I will tell him his patience with your misadventures has been>>
LINE<<rewarded with a weapon that will bring a swift end to the Rebellion.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<That was only an inkling of it's destructive potential.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<TARKIN>>

LINE<<I will tell him, that I will be taking control over the weapon>>
LINE<<I first spoke of years ago effective immediately.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<We stand here amid my achievement not yours!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<TARKIN>>

LINE<<I'm afraid these recent security breaches have laid bare your>>
LINE<<inadequacies as a military director.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<The breaches have been filled, Jedha has been silenced.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<TARKIN>>

LINE<<You think this pilot acted alone? He was dispatched from the>>
LINE<<installation on Eadu. Galen Erso's facility.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<We'll see about this.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<REBEL>>

LINE<<A coded message from Captain Andor, sir. Weapon confirmed. Jedha>>
LINE<<destroyed. Mission target located on Eadu. Please advise.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<GENERAL DRAVEN>>

LINE<<Destroyed? Proceed. Tell him my orders still stand. Tell him>>
LINE<<to proceed with haste and keep to the plan. We have no idea what>>
LINE<<he is building for the Empire. We have to kill Galen Erso while>>
LINE<<we have the chance.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<Baze, tell me. All of it? The whole city?Tell me.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<All of it.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Understood. Set a course for Eadu.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<Setting course for Eadu.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<Is that where my father is?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<I think so.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<So you're Galen's daughter.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<You know him?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<I'm Bodhi, the pilot.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<You brought the message.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<Yes, your father... He said I could get right by myself. He said>>
LINE<<I could make it right, if I was brave enough and listened to what>>
LINE<<was in my heart. Do something about it. Guess it was too late.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<It wasn't too late.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<Seems pretty late to me.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<No. We can beat the people who did this. My father's message,>>
LINE<<I've seen it. They call it the Death Star. But they have no idea>>
LINE<<there's a way to defeat it. You're wrong about my father.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<He did build it.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<Because he knew they'd do it without him. My father made a>>
LINE<<choice. He sacrificed himself for the Rebellion. He's rigged>>
LINE<<a>>
LINE<<trap inside it. That's why he sent you. To bring that message.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Where is it? Where's the message?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<It was a hologram.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<You have that message, right?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<Everything happened so fast.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Did you see it?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<You don't believe me.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<I'm not the one you've got to convince.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<I believe her.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<That's good to know.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BAZE>>

LINE<<What kind of trap? You said your father made a trap.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<The reactor. He's placed a weakness there. He's been hiding>>
LINE<<it>>
LINE<<for years. He said if you can blow the reactor- the module->>
LINE<<the>>
LINE<<whole system goes down. You need to send word to the Alliance.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<I've done that.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<They have to know there's a way to destroy this thing. They>>
LINE<<have>>
LINE<<to go to Scarif to get the plans.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<I can't risk sending that. We're in the heart of Imperial territory.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<Then we'll find him. And bring him back, and he can tell them>>
LINE<<himself.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<IMPERIAL NAVIGATOR>>

LINE<<Course set for Eadu, sir.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<20 degrees to the right. 10 degrees up.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<No, no, no, lower. Lower!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<Are you sure this is the way?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<They have landing trackers. They have patrol squadrons. You've>>
LINE<<got to stay in the canyon, keep it low.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Watch your right!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<There's a 26% chance of failure.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<How much farther?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<I don't know. I'm not sure, I never really come this way, but>>
LINE<<we're close, we're close. I know that.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<Well, now there's a 35% chance of failure.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<I don't want to know, thank you.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<I understand.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<Now! Put it down now!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<The wind...>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<If you keep going, you'll be right over the shuttle depot.>>
LINE<<Watch>>
LINE<<out!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<Hey!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Hold on tight! We're coming down hard!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<DRAVEN>>

LINE<<Try them again.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<REBEL>>

LINE<<I am, sir. We... The signal's gone dead.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<DRAVEN>>

LINE<<Squadron up, target Eadu.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<How about now, check stabilizers?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Bodhi, where's the lab?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<The research facility?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Yeah. Where is it?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<It's just over the ridge.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<And that's a shuttle depot straight ahead of us? You are sure>>
LINE<<of>>
LINE<<that?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<Yes. We'll have to hope there's still an Imperial ship left>>
LINE<<to>>
LINE<<steal.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Here's what we're doing. Hopefully, the storm keeps up and>>
LINE<<keeps>>
LINE<<us hidden down here. Bodhi, you're coming with me. We'll go>>
LINE<<up>>
LINE<<the ridge and check it out.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<I'm coming with you.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<No, your father's message, we can't risk it. You're the messenger.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<That's ridiculous. We all got the message. Everyone here knows>>
LINE<<it.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<One blast to the reactor module and the whole system goes down.>>
LINE<<That's how you said it. The whole system goes down.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Get to work fixing our comms! All I want to do right now is>>
LINE<<get>>
LINE<<a>>
LINE<<handle on what we're up against. So, we're going to go very>>
LINE<<small>>
LINE<<and very carefully up the rise and see what's what. Let's get>>
LINE<<out>>
LINE<<of here.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<Does he look like a killer?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BAZER>>

LINE<<No. He has the face of a friend.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<Who are you talking about?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<Captain Andor.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<Why do you ask that? What do you mean, does he look like a>>
LINE<<killer?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<The Force moves darkly near a creature that's about to kill.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<His weapon was in the sniper configuration.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<No, no, no... We got to go up. You can't see much from down>>
LINE<<there.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<This way.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<I'll be right behind you. Come on.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BAZE>>

LINE<<Where are you going?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<I'm going to follow Jyn. Her path is clear.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BAZE>>

LINE<<Alone? Good luck!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<I don't need luck, I have you!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<What are they doing? If Cassian comes back, we're leaving without>>
LINE<<them.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<You see Erso out there?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BAZE>>

LINE<<We've come too far.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CHIRRUT>>

LINE<<Patience, my friend.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<That's him. That's him, Galen, in the dark suit.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Get back down there, and find us a ride out of here.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<What are you doing?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<You heard me.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BODHI>>

LINE<<You said we came up here just to have a look.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<I'm here, I'm looking. Go. Hurry!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<Excellent news, Galen. The battle station is complete. You>>
LINE<<must>>
LINE<<be very proud.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<GALEN ERSO>>

LINE<<Proud as I can be, Krennic.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<Gather your engineers, I have an announcement. Is that all>>
LINE<<of>>
LINE<<them?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<GALEN ERSO>>

LINE<<Yes.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<Gentlemen. One of you betrayed the Empire. One of you has>>
LINE<<conspired with a pilot to send messages to the Rebellion. And>>
LINE<<I>>
LINE<<urge that traitor step forward.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<Very well, I'll consider it a group effort, then. Ready!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<ENGINEER>>

LINE<<No.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<ENGINEER>>

LINE<<No, please.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<Aim... and...>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<ENGINEER>>

LINE<<No, no.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<Fire!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<GALEN ERSO>>

LINE<<Stop! Stop! Krennic, stop. It was me. It was me. They have>>
LINE<<nothing to do with it. Spare them.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<Fire!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<How do I know the weapon is complete?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<GALEN ERSO>>

LINE<<Let me share with you some details.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<Cassian. Cassian, can you hear me?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<I'm here. You got it working.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<Affirmative yes, although we have a problem! There's an Alliance>>
LINE<<squadron approaching.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<REBEL PILOT>>

LINE<<Clear the area!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<No. No, no, no! Tell them to hold up! Jyn's on that platform!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<Jedha. Saw Gerrera. His band of fanatics. Their Holy City.>>
LINE<<The last reminder of the Jedi. Gone.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<GALEN>>

LINE<<You'll never win.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<Now where have I heard that before?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<Relay from Captain Andor.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<REBEL>>

LINE<<General.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<Captain Andor requesting a delay on squadron support. Alliance>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<DRAVEN>>

LINE<<Get the squadron leader on, Get him on now!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<REBEL>>

LINE<<They're already engaged, sir.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Dead. No.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<Papa. Papa, it's me. It's Jyn.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<GALEN ERSO>>

LINE<<Jyn. Stardust.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<Papa. I've seen your message. The hologram, I've seen it.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<GALEN ERSO>>

LINE<<It must be destroyed.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<I know. I know. We will.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<GALEN ERSO>>

LINE<<Jyn. Look at you. I've so much to tell you.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<Papa. No. No. Papa!Papa! Come on.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<STORMTROOPER>>

LINE<<Over there, take them down.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Come on. Jyn, we've got to go. Come on.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<I can't leave him,>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Listen to me. He's gone. There's nothing you can do. Come on.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<I can't leave him.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Come on! Help me. Move!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Down!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Come on. Come on.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<Well done. You're a Rebel now.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Let's go, let's go. Come on, let's move! Come on, let's get>>
LINE<<out of here. Move, move, move. Okay, K-2, let's go.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K-2SO>>

LINE<<Copy that.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<Ion thrusters low until we cleared the storm.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<K2-SO>>

LINE<<Understood.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<You lied to me.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<You're in shock.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<You went up there to kill my father.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<You don't know what you're talking about.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<Deny it.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<You're in shock, and looking for someplace to put it.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<I've seen it before.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<I bet you have.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<They know. You lied about why we came here and you>>
LINE<<lied about why you went up alone.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<I had every chance to pull the trigger. But did I? Did I?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<You might as well have. My father was living proof>>
LINE<<and you put him at risk. Those were Alliance bombs that killed>>
LINE<<him!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<I had orders! Orders that I disobeyed! But you wouldn't>>
LINE<<understand that.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<Orders? When you know they're wrong? You might as well be a>>
LINE<<stormtrooper.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<What do you know? We don't all have the luxury of deciding>>
LINE<<when and where we want to care about something. Suddenly the Rebellion>>
LINE<<is real for you? Some of us live it. I've been in this fight>>
LINE<<since I was 6 years old. You're not the only one who lost everything.>>
LINE<<Some of us just decided to do something about it.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JYN>>

LINE<<You can't talk your way around this.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<CASSIAN>>

LINE<<I don't have to. Yavin Four! Make sure they know we're coming>>
LINE<<in with a stolen ship. Anybody else?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<VANEE>>

LINE<<My lord, Director Krennic has arrived.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<DARTH VADER>>

LINE<<Director Krennic.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<Lord Vader.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<DARTH VADER>>

LINE<<You seem unsettled.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<No. Just pressed for time. There're a great many things to>>
LINE<<attend to.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<DARTH VADER>>

LINE<<My apologies. You do have a great many things to explain.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<I've delivered the weapon the Emperor requested. I>>
LINE<<deserve an audience to make certain he understands>>
LINE<<its remarkable... potential.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<DARTH VADER>>

LINE<<Its power to create problems has certainly been confirmed.>>
LINE<<A city destroyed. An Imperial facility openly attacked.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<It was Governor Tarkin that suggested the test.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<DARTH VADER>>

LINE<<You were not summoned here to grovel, Director Krennic.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<No, it's...>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<DARTH VADER>>

LINE<<There is no Death Star. The Senate has been informed that Jedha>>
LINE<<was destroyed in a mining disaster.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<Yes, my lord.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<DARTH VADER>>

LINE<<I expect you to not rest until you can assure the Emperor that>>
LINE<<Galen Erso has not compromised this weapon in any way.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<KRENNIC>>

LINE<<So I'm still in command? You'll speak to the Emperor about...>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<DARTH VADER>>

LINE<<Be careful not to choke on your aspirations, Director.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<PAMLO>>

LINE<<We must scatter the fleet. We have no recourse but to surrender.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<ORGANA>>

LINE<<Are we really talking about disbanding something that we've>>
LINE<<worked so hard to create?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<RADDUS>>

LINE<<We can't just give in.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<VASPAR>>

LINE<<We joined an Alliance, not a suicide pact!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<ORGANA>>

LINE<<We've only now managed to gather our forces.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<JEBEL>>

LINE<<Gather our forces? General Draven's already blown up an Imperial>>
LINE<<base!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<DRAVEN>>

LINE<<A decision needed to be made.>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<PAMLO>>

LINE<<If it's war you want, you'll fight alone!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<VASPAR>>

LINE<<If that's the way it's going, why have an Alliance at all?>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<RADDUS>>

LINE<<If she's telling the truth, we need to act now!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<MON MOTHMA>>

LINE<<Councilors, please!>>

CHARACTER_NAME<<BLUE LEADER>>
